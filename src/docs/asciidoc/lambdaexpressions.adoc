== Motivation and Purpose

* Functional programming is old, but has recently risen in importance.
* Functional programming is good.
* Well suited for concurrent and event-driven programming.
* Java is missing functional programming capabilites.

=== Lambda Expressions

* Java's functional programming constructs.
* Single most important change in Java in recent years.
* Java's version of closures.

=== Key Points

* block of code with parameters that can be _passed around_
* code that can be exuted _later_
* can be converted to functional interfaces
* can access effectively final variables from the enclosing scope

=== Not-so-obvious Consequences

* Method and constructor references refer to methods or constructors without invoking them.
* Default and static methods can be added to interfaces that provide concrete implementations.
* Conflicts between default methods from multiple interfaces must be resolved.

== Syntax

A lambda expression is composed of three parts:

|===
|Argument List|Arrow Token|Body

|(int x, int y)|->|x + y

|===

The body can be a _single expression_ or a _statement block_. 

=== Single Expressions

In the expression form, the body is simply evaluated and returned. 

[source,java]
----
() -> 66
(x,y) -> x + y
(Integer x, Integer y) -> x*y
(x) -> x > 0
----

=== Statement Blocks

In the block form, the body is evaluated like a method body and a return statement returns control to the caller of the anonymous method.

[source,java]
----
(String s) -> { System.out.println(s); } // returns nothing
(String s) -> { 
                 String b = s.toLowerCase(); 
                 System.out.println(b);
                 return b; // returns the lower case string
              }
----

== Functional Interface

* A _functional interface_ defines exactly one abstract method.
* Its signature is called _function descriptor_.
* Lambda expressions can provide _inline_ implementations of functional interfaces.
* Use @FunctionalInterface to indicate the intented use as functional interface, and compile time error checking for this.

=== Functional interfaces in Java 8  

|===
|Functional Interface|Function descriptor

|Predicate<T>        | T -> boolean
|Consumer<T>         | T -> void
|Supplier<T>         | () -> T
|Function<T,R>       | T -> R
//|UnaryOperator<T>    | T -> T

|===

=== More functional interfaces in Java

|===
|Functional Interface|Function descriptor

|Comparator<T>       | (T, T) -> int
|Runnable            | () -> void
|Callable<T>         | () -> T
|FileFilter          | File -> boolean

|===

=== Only _one_ abstract method

Default methods (e.g. _reversed()_) and methods inherited from Object (e.g. _equals_) do not count.

== Examples

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
interface CheckTrait {
  boolean test(Animal a);
}

static CheckTrait swimmer1 = a -> a.canSwim();
static CheckTrait swimmer2 = (Animal a) -> a.canSwim();
static CheckTrait swimmer3 = (Animal a) -> { return a.canSwim(); };

static Supplier<Animal> creator1 = () -> new Animal();
static Supplier<Animal> creator2 = Animal::new;

animals.add(creator1.get());
animals.stream().forEach(a -> swimmer2.test(a));
animals.stream().filter(a -> a.canSwim() && a.canHop()).count();
animals.stream().forEach(Animal::makeSound);
